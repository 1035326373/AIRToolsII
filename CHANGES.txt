Revisions in Version 2.0
------------------------

All ART, CART and SIRT functions now accept a function handle as input 
instead of a sparse matrix. This allows matrix-free versions of the system 
matrix to be used. This also allows interfacing to external functions 
implementing forward and backprojection. See the function afun_matrix for 
an example of the interface used.

All test problems now can return either the system matrix explicitly as a 
sparse matrix, or a function handle to allow matrix-free application of 
forward and backprojection operations, as determined by the boolean input 
isMatrix.

New test problem fanbeamtomolinear implementing a linear detector array 
unlike the curved detector array in the existing fanbeamtomo function.

The code has been reorganized in a modular fashion to allow more reuse of 
code, make it more reliable and easier to maintain.

The filtered backprojection method fbp.m introduced in version 1.3 has 
been removed.

New general interfaces art.m and sirt.m are introduced, which contain the 
core functionality of all ART and SIRT methods. This has turned all ART 
and SIRT files into wrappers of these. In addition to the provided methods
also custom methods can be constructed. For art.m this is done by passing 
in the order in which rows are to be traversed; for sirt.m by passing in 
function handles to the matrices M and T identifying the desired SIRT 
method.

More general bound constraints can be used. For both lower and upper 
bounds it is possible to specify either no constraint, a scalar enforced 
on all entries of x and a vector specifying elementwise constraints.

In paralleltomo, the default value of d has been changed to d=p-1. This 
choice leads for the default p to detector pixels of the same size as the 
image pixels.

For improved consistency across ART methods, psi1 and psi2 strategies for 
choosing the relaxation parameter have been removed from symkaczmarz.

TODO: Changes to stopping rules/which iterates are returned (now looking 
to next iterate instead of previous)

TODO: Describe new NCP criterion. Allowing 2D/multi1D residuals, as well 
as filtering.

In symkaczmarz a change of convention has been made. Previously a sweep 
top->bottom->top was counted as one iteration. Now it is counted as two 
iterations, and implemented by only allowing even numbers of iterations to 
be returned. This is in order to make the computational work of an 
iteration comparable to the other ART methods.

For SIRT methods, the possibility to give third input restart has been 
removed due to ambiguities and lack of demand. It is now possible to input 
a known largest singular value through a field s1 in the options struct.

The info output has been changed from a 3-element vector to a struct with 
more informative field names and more information such as the list of 
iterates returned.

artdemo.m now also contains a demonstration of the columnwise Kaczmarz 
method (CART) together with all ART methods (kaczmarz, symkaczmarz and 
randkaczmarz).


Revisions in Version 1.3
------------------------

A bug was found in fanbeamtomo, paralleltomo, and seismictomo that caused
some elements of the matrix A to incorectly be set to zero; it was fixed
in Version 1.2.

All iterative methods run faster and use less memory.

fanbeamtomo and paralleltomo now return the correct d.

rzr allows b with multiple columns.

All iterative methods now include box constraints.

All ART methods now include a damping factor to avoid division by
very small norms.

All SIRT methods had some of the stopping rules changed:
 - DP now always uses the standard residual vector r^k = b - A x^k,
 - ME now always uses 0.5 r^k'(r^{k+1}+r^k)/||r^k||_2.

The default value for lambda was changed to 1 in kaczmarz and symkaczmarz.

The default value for lambda was changed to 1.9/norm(A'*M*A) in all
SIRT methods.

New functions:
 - fbp             - filtered back projection, conforming to AIR Tools,
 - cart            - columnwise version of Kaczmarz's method (CART),
 - phantomgallery  - collection of 2D phantoms,
 - seismicwavetomo - similar to seismictomo but without ray model.

Note: for all ART methods NCP is implemented correct but it is not
recommended as it often leads to a very early termination. CART with
a random choice of columns converges very slowly and is not included.
